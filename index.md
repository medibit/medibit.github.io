## Welcome to the MediBit Website!

This website will help you through the 'Epileptic Stages' process of our Medibit LifeSaver & MediBit Hub products!

### Stage 1

Stage 1 is a minor epileptic fit. This stage has measured a G-Force of 3G and here is what to do when you get nofified of a Stage 1 fit:

In a simple focal seizure (SFS) a small part of the brain is affected. The person is conscious (aware and alert) and usually knows that the seizure is happening. A SFS could be an unusual smell or taste, a twitching of an arm or hand, a strange feeling such as a ‘rising’ feeling in the stomach or a sudden feeling of joy or fear.

How to help:

As the person might feel strange or be upset, reassuring them might be helpful.

### Stage 2

Stage 2 is a semi fit. This stage has a measured G-Force of 6G and here is what to do when you get notified of a Stage 2 fit:

Complex focal seizures (CFS) affect more of the brain than simple focal seizures. The person’s consciousness is affected and they may be confused and not know what they are doing. They might wander around, behave strangely, pick up objects or make chewing movements with their mouth. Afterwards, they be confused for a while or need to sleep. CFS can last a few seconds or a few minutes.

How to help:

do not restrain the person as this may upset or confuse them
gently guide them away from any danger for example from walking into the road
speak gently and calmly as they may be confused. If you speak loudly or grab them they might not understand and get upset or respond aggressively.
After the seizure:

they may feel tired and want to sleep. It might be helpful to remind them where they are.
stay with them until they recover and can safely return to what they had been doing before. Some people recover quickly but others may take longer to feel back to normal again.

### Stage 3 or 4

Stage 3 or 4 is a emergency fit. This stage has a measured G-Force of 8G and here is what to do when you get notified of a Stage 3 or 4 fit:

During a tonic clonic seizure the person goes stiff ('tonic' phase), usually falls to the ground, and shakes or makes jerking movements (convulsions or 'clonic' phase). Their breathing may be affected and they may go pale or blue, particularly around their mouth. They may also bite their tongue. Some people have clonic seizures without going stiff to start with.

Although it can be frightening to see, this is not usually a medical emergency. Usually, once the convulsions have stopped, the person recovers and their breathing goes back to normal.

How to help:

try to stay calm
check the time to see how long the seizure goes on for (because there may be a risk of status epilepticus - see below)
only move the person is they are in a dangerous place, for example in the road. Instead, move any objects, such as furniture, away from them so that they don't hurt themselves
put something soft (such as a jumper) under their head, or cup their head in your hands, to stop it hitting the ground
do not restrain them or hold them down - allow the seizure to happen
do not put anything in their mouth - they will not swallow their tongue
try to stop other people crowding around.
How to help once the shaking stops:

roll them on to their side into the recovery position
if their breathing sounds difficult or noisy, gently open their mouth to check that nothing is blocking their airway
wipe away any spit from their mouth
try to minimise any embarrassment. If they have wet themselves deal with this as privately as possible (for example, put a coat over them).
stay with them until they have fully recovered. They may need some gentle reassurance.
Some people recover quickly from a tonic clonic seizure but often they will be very tired, want to sleep and may not feel back to normal for several hours or sometimes days.

Most people's seizures will stop on their own and the person will not need any medical help. However, if you are not sure whether someone is recovering from a seizure, they have hurt themselves during the seizure, or you have any concerns about them, you might want to think about when to call for an ambulance.

Some people might injure themselves during a seizure. Dental injuries can be common.

Status in a tonic clonic (convulsive) seizure is a medical emergency and the person will need urgent medical help. It is important to call for an ambulance before the seizure goes on too long. Do not wait until it has lasted 30 minutes before calling for an ambulance. See when to dial 999.

Some people are prescribed emergency medication, either buccal midazolam or rectal diazepam, to stop their seizures. Carers need training in giving emergency medication. It is important to have an individualised written protocol (plan) about when to give it, for the carer to follow.
